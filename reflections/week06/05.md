# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This was a tough checkpoint for me. I feel like I'm having trouble grasping the concepts of vue. I'm not a fast coder, and I feel like I don't have to time to finish the labs and completely understand the content even when I work on it at home. It is frustrating for me.

I also feel like I don't understand the backend that we learned right before the hackathon. Coming into this week makes me nervous about the wednesday checkpoint. 

I'm starting to resent getting perfect checkpoints and all of my ducks up to this point. Once I don't receive one on a checkpoint, it will be a relief because I won't have so much pressure to continue to be perfect.
