# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I was really nervous about the capstone, I am always apprehensive about group projects. I do feel like I have a group that is easier to work with than I anticipated. I do feel like we're all contributing instead of one or two people always making the decisions. In this sense, I'm not so nervous about having an unfinished product, because right now, I would rather have good team dynamics over a perfect end product. 

I feel like working as a team is so important in this field. It doesn't matter how great of a developer you are, if no one wants to work with you, it makes the job much more difficult.
