# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I had several moments of insecurity having so many other people review or edit my code. I automatically assumed I wrote bad code and felt like a fraud. I wish I would have documented my code more so it would have been easier for myself and others to understand. I'm definitely going to have to work on this insecurity for the future.
