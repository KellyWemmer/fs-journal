## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Base64 provided a way of working around that by using an already open HTTP connection to deliver images embedded directly into the HTML or CSS. This effectively removed the need for an extra roundtrip the browser would need for each of the files

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

It still increases the file size for more than 25%. This not only increases your bandwidth bill, but also increases the download time

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

web browsers have become incredibly efficient in delivering hundreds of files through a single connection. This works around most limits that the Base64 encoding solved and in fact means Base64 now does more bad than good
