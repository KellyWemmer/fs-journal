# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I was able to find a better routine for studying outside of class, which has decreased my stress. I've also started working ahead on the journals. I'm trying to stay about a week ahead of schedule. Yesterday, I started feeling more comfortable with a couple of cohorts and started small conversations. I'm also feeling more comfortable asking for help from tutors and instructors, and have been doing this sooner rather than waiting until the last minute.  

I am still struggling with my own insecurities, however, they have improved over the last week.
