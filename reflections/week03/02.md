To protect data from the user by keeping it bundled into methods

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

Leaked implementation details, expanded attack surface for hackers

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

Everything inside an ES6 module is private by default, and runs in strict mode. This would be helpful because there is no way to see the private data unless exported.
