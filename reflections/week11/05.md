# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I'm a bit frustrated with my learning because I feel like I need to use so much reference code just to get through to the next challenge. I feel like I'm not really learning the material and that I need to take time after bootcamp to actually go back and figure out what I did over the course of the camp. 

I also get frustrated at all of the big egos among my cohorts, I get tired of my classmates constantly talking down to others or about others. I hear so much bullshit about which capstone group is the best, who's website is the best, who thinks they're better than the rest of their cohorts. I'm so sick of my classmates and their tremendous egos. If I never hear about those fucking ducks ever again, it will be too soon.
