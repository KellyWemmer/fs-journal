## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is used to ensure data in the specific column is unique. A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables.

2. What is an `Alias`?

SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name. Aliases are often used to make column names more readable

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsPatients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT
dp.*,
p.*,
d.*
FROM doctorsPatients dp
JOIN patients p on dp.patientId = p.id
JOIN doctors d ON p.creatorId = d.id
WHERE dp.id = @dp.id
```
