## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

The simplest form of SQL injection is through user input. 
An attacker can also modify cookies to poison a web applicationâ€™s database query
Second-order SQL injection attacks are the sneakiest of the bunch, because they arenâ€™t designed to run immediately, but much later.

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

A web application firewall (WAF) can detect and block basic SQL injection attacks, but you shouldnâ€™t rely on it as the sole preventive measure.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS), both network- and host-based, can be tuned to detect SQL injection attacks.
